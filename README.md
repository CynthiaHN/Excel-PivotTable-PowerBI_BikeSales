# Data Cleaning and Visualisation- Sales of Bike 

In this project, we are looking at potential factors that affect the consumers make a purchase decision on a bike. By implementing this, I used Excel to clean data and create the dashboard using Pivot tables in Excel to give a basic understanding of how factors are correlated to others. I then used Power BI to create data visualization for the final analysis. 

## Aims:
+ Using Excel to clean, format and filter the dataset.
